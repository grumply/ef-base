-- Simple Example:
--
--    > managed $ \Manager{..} -> do
--    >     (handle,fileToken) <- allocate (io $ openFile "./file.tmp") hClose
--    >     result <- withHandle handle something
--    >     return result -- hClose will happen before the return
--
-- Resources are released in LIFO order as expected. Tokens may be registered
-- with other managers with an action to perform upon manager scope completion.
-- Tokens may be unregistered to prevent cleanup actions in individual managers.
-- Tokens may be deallocated which forces registered cleanup actions to be
-- performed in all managers for which that token is registered in LIFO order
-- of the nesting scopes.
