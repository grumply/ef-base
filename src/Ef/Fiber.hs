--                    ThreadDone r      -> ... -- finished with r

-- Note: I suggest not using this unless you absolutely know that you need it
-- and all that its use implies, including the ease with which it allows you to
-- introduce bugs based around atomicity assumptions. For instance, imagine a
-- get-modify-put method in a shared context (forked threads share root context):
--
-- @
--   getModifyPut modify = do
--       current <- get
--       let new = modify current
--       put new
-- @
--
-- And a use case like this:
--
-- @
--   fibers $ \Threader{..} -> do
--       fork $ do
--           ...
--           getModifyPut updateFunction
--           ...
--       fork $ do
--           ...
--           getModifyPut updateFunction
--           ...
-- @
--
-- if the call to put happens to be preempted in both threads, one will likely
-- overwrite the result of the other. It is easy to remedy with a call to
-- `focus`, which is similar to a call to atomic, like this:
--
-- @
--   fibers $ \Threader{..} -> do
--       fork $ do
--           ...
--           focus $ getModifyPut updateFunction
--           ...
-- @
--
-- but it is easy to believe that your method won't need the call, which leads
-- you into the trap. This issue becomes even more difficult if you nest calls
-- to fiber and fork, in which case a call to the atomic primitive `focus` in
-- the n-th context is, interestingly, not atomic in the context of the n-m call
-- to fiber for all m > 0.
